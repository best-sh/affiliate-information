When you register for Notion using this affiliate link, you receive $10 in free credit. I receive $5 in credit as well. Notion provides me with your email address and profile picture after registering. I am not able to disable this, unfortunately. I will not share any of this information.

Notion's $4/month plan is free for students with an `.edu` email address. I would still encourage you to register with the affiliate link, as I receive credit even if your plan is free!

It's completely understandable if you choose not to use the affiliate link.
